In this Game, you play as an elder that's tired of people invading his favorite park.
Being too old, the only way to get rif of unwanted visitors is to attract the nearby birds with bread.
If the birds see Bread, they will fly to it and Kill anything in their path.
The Birds obey to a flocking algorithm, so that they stick together but never make contact.
You can attract a whole flock or try and divide the flock in half so that you can cover different parts of the map.
However, if the birds hit you once, you character will collapse !

The way that this game incorporates VR is for its aiming, as one cannot aim with the controller, moving your head is crutial to get the right angle.
The usual motion sickness is cancelled by the fact that the character, an old man, moves so slow that it doesn't make you as sick.
